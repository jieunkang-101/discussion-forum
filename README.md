# Discussion Forum

#### React with Redux practice, 4.28.2020

#### By **_Jieun Kang_**

## 1. Description
Forums application where users may post news, pictures, and other information around a certain topic. Other users can then upvote or downvote content. The more upvotes an item receives, the higher it's displayed on the list. Recreate a basic subreddit and/or vote-based discussion board using React and Redux.

### :small_orange_diamond: User stories:
  * As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
  * As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too.
  * As a user, I want to upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
  * As a user, I want to downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
  * As a user, I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page. (We haven't explicitly covered this in our curriculum, but here's a hint: You can complete logic before the return statement of a mapStateToProps() method!)
